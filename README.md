### time_utilities.ads
1. create a procedure for incrementing Time_Value.Minute
2. remove invariant on Time_Value, then create two Integer subtypes that makes sense for hour and minute
3. create functions for getting Time_Value.Minute and Time_Value.Hour
4. turn on SPARK, what does the prover find or not find?
### simple_math_utilities.ads
1. alter the package body so Pre and Post pass but Global and Depends fail (SPARK -> Prove All)
